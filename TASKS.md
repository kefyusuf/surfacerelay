# Implementation Task Board

Status values: `TODO`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `BLOCKED`, `DONE`.

A task is DONE only after required verification passes. SurfaceRelay implements one task at a time; do not begin the next task automatically.

> Historical per-task evidence through T-505 is preserved in `docs/archive/TASKS-through-T505-preclosure.md`. Design specs, implementation plans, `STATUS.md`, `REVIEW_REQUEST.md`, PR discussions, and Git history contain detailed evidence for later tasks.

```

T-601 proved that the generic `RuntimeBinding` envelope can carry a page-scoped HTMX target with source/path/named-input semantics without changing `ActionDefinition` or moving trusted authority into browser data.

```

T-602 proved exact source resolution, physical request-declaration validation, supported HTMX 2.x public runtime execution, fail-closed input mapping and the HTMX-specific cancellation/dispatch frontier.

```

T-603 proved the HTMX adapter against a real non-Laravel Node application, real `htmx.org@2.0.10`, real Chromium DOM/network execution and the existing `prep_list.add_item@1` ActionDefinition. Human and SurfaceRelay paths converge on the same `POST /items` business mutation and response swap. At the T-603 closure point `D-020` was still proposed; it was later accepted only after T-604 completed shared cross-driver conformance.

### T-604 — Shared conformance against Livewire + HTMX — DONE / REVIEWED / MERGED / MAIN REVALIDATED

Design / plan:

docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-13-binding-driver-conformance-design.md
docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-14-binding-driver-conformance.md
```

Verified implementation boundary:

- one shared executable 11-case matrix is declared once in `packages/browser-runtime/tests/support/binding-driver-conformance-suite.ts`;
- that exact matrix runs unchanged against production `LivewireBrowserDriver` and production `HtmxBrowserDriver` through thin test-only adapters;
- shared assertions cover fail-closed target validation, expiry classification, Action-input mappability, exact-target stale/no-retarget behavior, exact dispatch count, and already-aborted no-dispatch cancellation;
- every shared failure case proves zero unintended framework dispatch;
- equivalent replacement identities receive zero dispatch from an old binding;
- framework-specific target shapes, lifecycles, runtime APIs, local error codes, cancellation mechanisms and successful return values remain driver-owned;
- no production browser-runtime source, frozen spec, Laravel source, T-603 fixture, workflow, package dependency, or `tsconfig.json` changed;
- T-701 was not implemented or pulled forward.

Closure decisions:

- `D-058` — **ACCEPTED** for the tested shared behavioral `BindingDriver` overlap. Acceptance does not normalize framework-specific behavior and does not create a public T-701-style conformance SDK/runner.
- `D-020` — **ACCEPTED**. The T-601–T-603 HTMX path is materially different from Livewire in lifecycle, driver target, input mapping, runtime API and dispatch behavior, while T-604 proves both implementations satisfy the same common binding-driver invariants.
- Together with `D-009`, this establishes the required two materially different bindings + shared executable scenarios threshold. It does **not** automatically authorize extracting a standalone public specification; that remains a separate future decision/task.

**T-604 is closed. M6 is closed.**

## M7 — Conformance / Ecosystem Bridges — TODO

- T-701 — Executable conformance runner — TODO.
- T-702 — Adapter author guide — TODO.
- T-703 — Laravel MCP projection using a maintained MCP implementation — TODO.
- T-704 — Optional OpenAPI importer as a secondary adapter — TODO.

## Current boundary

M6 is **DONE / REVIEWED / MERGED / MAIN REVALIDATED**. T-604 is closed and `D-058` / `D-020` are **ACCEPTED**. The next listed task is T-701, but it has **not started** and requires a new explicit user gate.
