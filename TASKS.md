# Tasks

Open work only. Each task: scope, acceptance, verification. Completed tasks keep a
one-line entry; full history is in
[`docs/archive/TASKS-through-2026-10-04.md`](docs/archive/TASKS-through-2026-10-04.md).

## Open

### T-805 — Integrated release-readiness verification

One revision/version input, both candidate artifacts, full regression, clean-consumer
evidence, hashes, publication go/no-go handoff. Publication itself stays outside
(D-073) and needs an explicit owner go.
